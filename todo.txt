Remaining stuff:
-------------------------
-Real Login
-Filler pages, mostly just css to write here
-Check CSS for different DPIs
-bitcoin wiki descriptions

-still a bug on adding coins, graph gets messed up sometimes b/c time ranges off i think
	-in fact, it happens once in a while even just on first fetch.
	-perhaps i could solve this in transformGraphSpaceTo

Polish:

-Fix lag on graphs. Seems to be due to lot of SVGs. Can render to canvas/png since mostly static
-Improve CSS
-Organize code/CSS
-Animations
