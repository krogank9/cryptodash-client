-navbar and sidebar need some filler. too bare right now
-graph colors could maybe use some work. seem slightly too close or something. maybe make not transparent.
-webpack? something clean and fancy to speed up file loading base64 prevent FOUT etc
-hamburger menu icon needs to be like a staggered menu icon visually hinting that it will slide menu in and out.
 might change icon packs or just find an icon only for the hamburger menu part that works
-organize css properties by type so it looks really pretty (do when done maybe)

-graph is going to need to be made a bit more dynamic, modular. need to add candlestick, some type of slider/scrubber, intro animations,
 more interactivity. this will be a big part of remaining frontend work

-some form of css transform on graph plot svg so we're not redrawing every frame on transitions

-anything that touches server/fetch code should handle malformed inputs gracefully
